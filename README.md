# Incident Handler’s Journal

## Overview
This repository presents an incident handler’s journal from a cybersecurity training course, documenting hands-on exercises in incident detection and response. As an aspiring security analyst, I analyzed ransomware and malicious file incidents, used tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, and VirusTotal, and applied NIST CSF principles. Reflecting my skills in problem-solving and protecting organizations from digital threats, with a focus on web-related incidents like phishing.

## Objectives
- Document and analyze cybersecurity incidents from a course journal.
- Use tools (Wireshark, tcpdump, VirusTotal) to investigate network traffic and threats.
- Summarize findings with Python and propose NIST CSF-aligned mitigations.

## Tools Used
- **Framework**: NIST CSF (Respond/Recover functions).
- **Tools**: Wireshark, tcpdump (network analysis), VirusTotal (threat investigation).
- **Documentation**: PDF journal, Markdown.

## Repository Structure
- `incident_journal.pdf`: Journal documenting ransomware, network analysis, and file hash investigations.


## Key Findings
- **Ransomware Incident**: Phishing-based attack on a healthcare company, mitigated by system shutdown (NIST CSF RS.CO-2).
- **Malicious File**: Email attachment with malicious hash detected at a financial company, analyzed via VirusTotal.
- **Network Analysis**: Captured and analyzed traffic using Wireshark and tcpdump, identifying potential threats.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Enhance email filtering to block phishing.
  - Train employees on recognizing malicious attachments.
  - Deploy IDS/IPS for real-time monitoring.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/usman-emtee/Incident-Handlers-Journal.git`
2. Review the journal in `incident_journal.pdf`.

## Disclaimer
This journal is based on a fictional training scenario. Always obtain permission before analyzing real systems.
